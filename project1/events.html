<div class="article1"><h4>Jeju haenyeos wore a bathing suit made of cotton-broadcloth in white or black (100% cotton with 30 counts, about 0.5 mm thick, and 8.5% water absorption at a dry condition) until wetsuits were supplied. Before the broad cotton cloth was imported from Japan, the bathing suit was originally made of muslin (thin cotton cloth). Haenyeos preferred the broad cotton to the muslin bathing suit because the broad cotton was relatively thicker and stronger in salty water than the muslin cloth. The traditional cotton suit consisted of ‘so-jung-ee (bathing suit)’, ‘juck-sam (upper)’, and ‘mul-su-gun (hood)’ without any goggles (Fig. 1). In winter, haenyeos wore the juck-sam over the so-jung-ee.

Jeju haenyeos who went to Japan for diving work came back to Jeju bringing their own wetsuits from Japan in the early 1970’s. Figure 4 shows the wetsuits currently worn by haenyeos in Jeju. In those days, flippers were also supplied with the wet suits. </h4></div>
