<div class="article2"><h4>Jeju's diving tradition dates back to 434 A.D. Originally, diving was an exclusively male profession, with the exception of women who worked alongside their husbands.<br><br> The first mention of female divers in literature does not come until the 17th century when a monograph of Jeju geography describes them as jamnyeo (literally “diving women").
  <br><br>By the 18th century, female divers, at this point commonly referred to as haenyeo, outnumbered male divers. Several possible explanations exist for this shift. For instance, in the 17th century, a significant number of men died at sea due to war or deep-sea fishing accidents, meaning that diving became the work of women. An 18th-century document records that taxes of dried abalone were imposed on ordinary people, forcing many women to dive in cold waters while pregnant.<br><br>As the Korean colony turned into a capitalist system of imperialism, its cities grew and became centers of modern development and rural areas were marginalized. However, while the city became the main space for the New Women, the rural areas of Jeju saw the emergence of a group of women who would also have significant influence on female empowerment. The Haenyeo, whose job was diving to pick seafood, were experts conducting economic activities in their own sphere. They were only seen as an image of wondrous strong women who had lived at the border between life and death in a traditional way of labor on the tough marine environment.
